# Fantastic Kit ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Command line utility `fk` (stands for **F**antastic **K**it) 10x your development productivity. 

`fk` provides some useful commands that increase developers productivity. `fk` assumes all git source directory locate at `$HOME/src/github.com/`.

## Installation

### Bash

Run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fantastic-kit/fantastic-kit/master/bin/install.sh | bash`

### Fish

Install fantastic kit using fisher. Run `fisher add fantastic-kit/fantastic-kit`

The fish flavour does not support all the features, but they're going to be implemented soon. Currently, fish supports:

- `fk cd`
- `fk clone`
- `fk pr`

## Built-in commands

### fk cd

`cd` into a project located in `$HOME/src/github.com`, also supports zsh-autosuggest prompt.

### fk clone

`git clone` a repository from github into `$HOME/src/github.com/` and `cd` into the project directory. It reads from `.gitconfig` for username for github.

Cloning your own repository

``` bash
fk clone <my-own-repo>
```

Cloning someone else's public repo:

``` bash
fk clone <git-username>/<repo-name>
```

### fk pr

Open github PRs if opened inside a git directory if the current branch is not master branch.

``` bash
fk pr
```

### fk repo

Open current repo on github

``` bash
fk repo
```

### fk `<custom-cmd>`

Create `kit.yml` file at the root of the project. Add custom commands to `commands` section.

Example `kit.yml`: it compiles latex to pdf based on name of the subdirectory:

``` yaml
commands:
  latex:
    run:  latexmk -pdf -pvc $(pwd | xargs basename).tex
    desc: compiling latex file to pdf on change
```

Then you can just run `fk latex` anywhere inside the root directory where `kit.yml` is located.
